# Election Exit Poll Prediction
 The is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted.
 
 This is a classification problem.I tried different algorithms.
   •Logistic Regression\n
   •Random forest\n
   •Support Vector Machine\n
   •K Nearest Neighbour\n
   •Naive Bayes\n
   •Linear Discriminant Analysis\n
   •Adaboost\n
   •XGBoost\n
   
   I did hyper parameter tuning and selected optimum model as final model.
